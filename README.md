> #InverteFest is a periodic online event where we invite you to celebrate the overlooked invertebrate fauna around you and share the joys of discovery online. <br/>The hashtag was conceived when [Franz Anthony](https://franzanth.com/) and [Maureen Bug](https://maureenbug.github.io/) went looking for bugs and slugs in Bali. [Kelly Brenner](https://www.metrofieldguide.com/), stuck in Seattle, wondered if we could invite our online friends to look for bugs and slugs together in spirit, even though weâ€™re physically far apart. Besides, what may be an everyday creature to you is often exciting to someone who lives half the world away!

During this summer's (2023) \#Invertefest, I randomly decided it would be neat to try and make a phylogenetic tree from all the iNat observations.
